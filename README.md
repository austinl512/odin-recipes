# odin-recipes
For this HTML Foundations project, I created a simple recipe website that consists of a main index page that links to three other recipe pages.
After completing this project, I was able to demostrate my knowledge in working with tags and elements in HTML. I also showcased what I learned when working with text, lists, and images in HTML.
Moreover, this project enabled me to get more familiar with Git and my commit messages.
